Product Requirements Document (PRD): Reddit Problem Validation System
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a system designed to identify and validate real-world problems using Reddit data. The system integrates Reddit scraping, agentic AI analysis, and user workflows to provide actionable insights for micro-SaaS development.
2. System Overview
The system consists of three main components:
1. Reddit Scraper: Collects data from Reddit using the Reddit API and web scraping tools.
2. Agentic AI: Analyzes the scraped data to validate proposed problems using techniques like sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
3. User Interface: Allows users to propose problems, view data summaries, and receive AI-driven insights.
3. Features
The system will include the following features:
- Problem Proposal: Users can input a problem statement for validation.
- Data Collection: Scrapes relevant Reddit posts and comments based on keywords and subreddits.
- AI Analysis: Uses sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and clustering to validate the problem.
- Insights Dashboard: Displays summarized data and validation results.
4. Technical Requirements
The system will require the following technologies:
- Backend: Python, Flask/Django, PRAW, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.
- AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Hugging Face Transformers for NLP tasks.
- Database: MongoDB for unstructured data, PostgreSQL for structured data.
- Frontend: React.js or Angular for the user interface.
5. User Workflow
1. User inputs a problem statement into the system.
2. The system scrapes relevant Reddit data based on keywords and subreddits.
3. Agentic AI analyzes the data to validate the problem.
4. The system displays a summary of the data and validation results in the dashboard.
6. Challenges and Considerations
- Data Privacy: Ensure compliance with Reddit's terms of service and user privacy regulations.
- Scalability: Design the system to handle large-scale data scraping and analysis.
- Ethical Use: Avoid misuse of scraped data and ensure transparency in AI analysis.
