Project Management Plan (PMP): Reddit Problem Validation System
1. Project Overview
This document outlines the project management plan for building a system that identifies and validates real-world problems using Reddit data. The project includes Reddit scraping, agentic AI analysis, and user interface development.
2. Objectives
- Develop a robust Reddit scraper for data collection.
- Implement agentic AI for problem validation using NLP techniques.
- Design a user-friendly interface for data visualization and insights.
3. Project Scope
The project will cover the following phases:
1. Requirements Gathering and Planning.
2. Development of the Reddit Scraper.
3. Implementation of Agentic AI Analysis.
4. User Interface Design and Development.
5. Testing and Deployment.
4. Timeline and Milestones
The project is expected to be completed in 12 weeks. Key milestones include:
- Week 1-2: Requirements Gathering and Planning.
- Week 3-5: Development of Reddit Scraper.
- Week 6-8: Implementation of Agentic AI Analysis.
- Week 9-10: User Interface Design and Development.
- Week 11: Testing and Quality Assurance.
- Week 12: Deployment and Documentation.
5. Resource Allocation
The project will require the following resources:
- **Team Members**:
  - 1 Project Manager.
  - 2 Backend Developers.
  - 1 AI/ML Engineer.
  - 1 Frontend Developer.
  - 1 QA Engineer.
- **Tools and Technologies**:
  - Python, Flask/Django, PRAW, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.
  - TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Hugging Face Transformers.
  - MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
  - React.js or Angular.
6. Risk Management
Potential risks and mitigation strategies include:
- **Data Privacy Issues**: Ensure compliance with Reddit's terms of service and anonymize user data.
- **Scalability Challenges**: Use distributed systems and cloud-based solutions for scalability.
- **Delays in Development**: Implement agile methodologies and conduct regular progress reviews.
7. Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful if:
- The system can scrape and analyze Reddit data efficiently.
- Users can validate problems and view actionable insights.
- The system meets performance, scalability, and usability requirements.
