Some notes:

* Aiming for a mid to senior-level UXD or PD role.
* Had a little over 3yrs experience in my last PD role and was laid off a few weeks ago. Before that, had some freelance UI work, totaling me about 4yrs professional “design for tech” experience. I have about 12yrs graphic design experience before all that.
* Worried about showing an employment gap. I have a on and off freelance practice (one current UX contract set to end in a month, carryover client from my last job) and will continue to seek freelance/contract work until I land a full time job.
* Struggling to land interviews or even get hits on my portfolio site. Happy to share via DM
* Occasional message from recruiters via LinkedIn, they seem to see potential, but rigid hiring requirements or my YOE disqualify me immediately
* Wondering if I am underselling my prev design experience?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1keb2w4/portfolio_case_study_and_resume_feedback_050425/mqkfjnt/,2025-05-04T17:23:51+00:00

I don’t want to just throw in a bunch of flashy mock ups without any actual thought to the process, especially considering I want to break into UXR/UX design.

comment_mqt0fch,post_1keb2w4,comment,UXDesign,,"Hello, I'm currently working on a new portfolio after moving to a new city. I've been working at a digital agency for the last 3 and a half years (was also my first job out of uni) and the work itself has been quite diverse. This means that I now seem to weirdly occupy a space between a UX/UI role and that of a graphic designer as I worked on both branding, motion design and UX/UI during my time there. My portfolio kind of represents this and I worry that maybe it all feels just a bit too broad for employers who want a particular designer. I think I definitely want to pursue UX/UI more with flexibility to work across motion design and branding if needed - but digital is the focus here. 

[https://joshahayes.com/](https://joshahayes.com/)

I feel like my case studies are visually quite nice but I see a lot of UX portfolios here referencing data, strategy and research with lots of copy which is something that I did not necessarily focus on during my time at the agency. I of course designed wireframes and was involved in UX strategy meetings but my main focus was more on the UI itself. We usually had other people in the agency that worked on strategy and research beforehand.

If I want to be taken seriously as a UX/UI designer, do I need to include more insights into the strategy, planning and design process in my case studies?

post_1kgj2qx,,post,UXDesign,Duolingo leader throws shade at r/UXDesign,"You all might remember this thread a few months ago, [debating Duolingo renaming UX to “Product Experience.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1j3hvkw/duolingo_renames_ux/) The VP Mig announced this with fanfare on LinkedIn.

On the most recent [Dive Club podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVJUmJKrZKA&t=355s), Mig and the host Ridd have some pointed words towards r/UXDesign  Here’s the relevant part of the transcript:

>Host: ...I was on an episode, and I said, effectively, I would not apply for a job that was UX designer, because that immediately communicates an old world way of thinking, and maybe at its core, the definition is correct, but it doesn't really matter because the perception has changed around those two letters, I think. 

>Mig (Duolingo): I agree with you, and I think this is almost an uncomfortable thing to say in the industry, but I do think UX design is somewhat of an archaic term, and I think, I think it was Jakob Nielsen who went on my LinkedIn and said, you're wrong, and we should fight for you. 

>Host: You got a Jakob Nielsen comment saying you're wrong. That's the gold standard. That's like, it doesn't get it at higher praise than that. 

>Mig: And it's like, hey, thank you, I read your books, but also, I've also built product here with other people, and none of us resonate with the title UX Designer. 

>Okay, so at Duolingo, we've never had the title UX designer, we've always been product designer. At Instagram, where I worked for three and a half years prior to Duolingo, it was never UX designer. It was always product designer. And the thing I, I'll like peel a curtains back on and hiring for consumer- facing companies, whether it's Instagram, Duolingo, Airbnb Coinbase, all my friends at other consumer companies, we almost get nervous when we have designers with UX designer titles come to interview because you're going to think about a few things, but not all the things, which as visual design, business metrics, building things with engineers. A lot of what UX design symbolizes or communicates to a lot of hiring managers is I'm pretty far from the work and I just want to do my end to end flow. You will never see a UX designer job opening at an Airbnb, a meta, etcera, because the product matters, and the title has been product designer for more than a decade, some of the most reputable consumer companies in the world at Duolingo expects to be one of those companies. 

>Host: I appreciate you coming on and being willing to even talk about it, because it is something that I've been feeling, and it feels weird to say, you know, like It feels super weird. put it, yeah, putting it on the internet, you know, you're just invite Backlash, you know, my God, you post us on LinkedIn. Like, they'll headhunt you, you know? I hang out on the **UX design subreddit** from time to time, almost just because it's like a **window into the complete opposite world of Twitter,** really. Like, it's like, actually helpful to see that. **Okay, there's like this real bubble that's happening here and I don't know, just the other day, I felt bad.** Like somebody was coming on like 20 years experience and we shared a portfolio and basically was like, I cannot get a job. Why can I not get a job? I looked at the portfolio and, you know, there was a visual design bar that wasn't being hit, but it was the title was like, UI/UX accessibility. And I was like, you know, you're not going to want to hear this, but I think a large percentage of the industry is writing you off just from that way of defining yourself. 

>Mig: I would double down and underscore what you said. I think having been a hiring manager for more than a decade of consumer companies, when we see job titles that say UI/UX, I go, do you know what you're doing? Yeah. Which is it? It is funny. The **UX design subreddit is maybe not the place you want to grow your career or learn**. In a lot of my peer groups and even on my team, at Duolingo, friends from Instagram, other companies, we also will kind of scrub through UX design **subreddit** or blind or other anonymous forums where, you know, you want to confide in your peer group, I **think where I have in all the wrong conversations in those places,** I think, you know, it's 2025 and people are still debating is it UI/UX? UX vs. UI? And it's like we’re all building products so. So when you're ready to talk about excellent prototyping, high visual design, really thoughtful design details, and then really understanding revenue, daily active users, all in the same conversation, come on over, you'll up your chances on getting a job at a big publicly traded tech company, if that is your goal. But there's still merit to that in startups where we care about revenue, metrics, but also craft. And so there's two worlds in the industry, the people that have the jobs that are doing the work and they're oriented around building products businesses and doing great things for users. And then there's the people that are on these **Reddits** going, what's our title or Here we go, another person changing the title. And it's like,Is this really how we want to spend our time moving our industry forward? And so I do encourage a lot of people to go there for entertainment value, but it's not learning value.

I have mine at the foot of my resume and the number of emails I still get asking for a password are laughable at this point, so while I’m redesigning my resume I’m moving it to the very top.

Second, password protect only the things that need to be protected.

Especially in this market with 1000 applications per role. Put a ""request access"" link there and you can forget it. Only the very dedicated will bother (you're a referral or they really like what they see in your other public studies and MUST see this private one before calling you for an interview.)

Hang Xu is a design recruiter who confirmed this in a recent Q&A and he said the better choice is to **create an unlisted URL.** This is one anyone can access, but isn't indexed by search engines and has no crawlable inbound links to expose it. Most website builders have this option.

Example: [yourname.com/unlisted\_projectname](http://yourname.com/unlisted_projectname)

My advice goes one step further, which is to create an unlisted landing page specifically **for the company you applied to.** On that landing page include unlisted links to the projects you want them to see and why. This makes it a nice personalized hub for them. Put your intro letter here too.

Landing Page: [yourname.com/unlisted\_employername](http://yourname.com/unlisted_employername)

For people who end up on your homepage, and want to see those unlisted projects, list them, but link each to a landing page that explains its private and instructs them to use the URL provided in your application, or ""request access"" to receive it from you.",30,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1kgakua/thoughts_on_password_protection_for_portfolios/mqxtbw3/,2025-05-06T19:31:45+00:00

post_1kgml3z,,post,UXDesign,A Modest Proposal — A Manifesto for Metrics-First Everything,"Picture it: Q1 FY 2025. A Medicaid patient opens an app to request mental health services. The screen is sleek—gradient buttons, playful microinteractions, and conversion-optimized flows. A calm animation winks: “*Start your healing journey now.”* We A/B tested that language; it works. But the form doesn’t support screen readers. There’s no offline access. The language requires a 12th-grade reading level. And the only contact option is an AI chatbot with a 5-second latency.

I designed that, and I’m proud to say we hit our OKRs *two quarters early*.

I'm Senior Product Experience Designer — not “UX” because that's what people who couldn’t learn Figma call themselves. I came of age in the golden years: Instagram post-acquisition, Figma post-beta, Duolingo post-gamification. Back then, I learned quickly that nothing kills velocity like a conversation about trauma-informed design, or a stakeholder saying, *“I talked to a user.”* That’s not product. That’s vibes.

\-----

**Case Study: What does ethical design look like with quarterly KPIs?**

At my first startup, I redesigned a benefits app for undocumented workers. We trimmed a 9-screen application into a 3-screen onboarding funnel. “Elegant.” “Efficient.”

Turns out we accidentally disqualified half our users by requiring a permanent address and Alien Registration Numbers on the first page. Oops. But I’d already been promoted. I even got featured on *that design podcast that shall not be named* where we all whisper about [people who still use Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/).

\-----

**Case Study: scaling engagement before legal notices**

Later, I led PulseCheck™, a mental health journaling app for gig workers. DAU *exploded* after we added streaks and push reminders, especially among users with bipolar disorder and OCD.

We considered a “snooze” feature, but our CPO-CEO said it felt like we didn’t have confidence in our own value prop. I agreed: You can’t pivot to empathy mid-funnel. It’s bad for retention and messes up the cohort analysis.

post_1kgbhq8,,post,UXDesign,Designing for AI feels like UX without control.,"With AI interfaces, especially ones powered by LLMs, the experience changes every time.  
There’s no fixed flow, no guaranteed output, just probabilities.

It made me realize most UX principles assume predictability. But when the system itself *thinks*, the user’s sense of control gets blurry.

Anyone else navigating this shift?",35,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1kgbhq8/designing_for_ai_feels_like_ux_without_control/,2025-05-06T18:13:12+00:00
comment_mqxpoln,post_1kgbhq8,comment,UXDesign,,"I've been wrestling with this exact challenge for the past 18 months. When we introduced AI-powered grading assistants for our writing platform, it completely upended my understanding of what constitutes good UX.

Usually interfaces give users a sense of control through predictability - click this button, get that result. But with LLMs, that implicit contract breaks down. The same input produces variable outputs, and that fundamentally changes the relationship between user and system.

What we discovered through teacher feedback sessions wasn't that they needed perfect consistency (which AI can't provide), but rather appropriate influence over a system they couldn't fully predict. Teachers felt undermined when AI grading produced different feedback on identical essays submitted twice.

Imo our breakthrough came from reframing the problem. Instead of trying to make AI act like traditional software, we embraced its probabilistic nature but created specific control points:

1. We designed structured input mechanisms for teachers to calibrate the system through explicit parameters - content standards, rubrics, exemplar responses
2. We built batch testing tools where we could validate across multiple submissions before deploying
3. Most importantly, we created deliberate touchpoints where teacher judgment explicitly supersedes AI assessment

So really this approach preserves teacher agency while leveraging AI capabilities. The interface acknowledges where algorithms excel (processing volume) and where human expertise remains irreplaceable (nuanced judgment).

At our company, we've deliberately avoided implementing too many ""open"" AI workflows for precisely this reason. After extensive testing, we found that highly constrained AI interfaces with clear teacher control points deliver consistently better outcomes than free-form AI interactions. The open-ended nature of many AI implementations creates more confusion than clarity, especially in our education contexts where structure and consistency remain pedagogically important. I have learned that more often than not the most effective AI is the one with the most thoughtfully designed limitations.",27,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1kgbhq8/designing_for_ai_feels_like_ux_without_control/mqxpoln/,2025-05-06T19:14:03+00:00

comment_mqyvm3e,post_1kghmbf,comment,UXDesign,,"I am sorry you had to deal with this. Similar situations can happen in professional settings, there are established practices that help prevent these issues.

First, involving developers early in the design process is crucial. When developers understand the reasoning behind design decisions and feel included, they're more likely to support implementation as intended. This collaborative approach builds mutual respect and reduces the likelihood of major changes later.

Second, always ask for specific reasons when someone wants to change your design. Vague comments like “it's ugly” aren't constructive feedback. Push for concrete explanations like “What specific elements aren't working? How does this not meet our project requirements or user needs?” Having these discussions in structured design critiques rather than casual conversations helps maintain professionalism.

For your current situation, I would recommend:
- Request a proper design critique with clear criteria based on project goals and user needs, not subjective opinions
- Document your design work thoroughly for your portfolio regardless of implementation
- If you're responsible for specific designs, it's appropriate to professionally hold your ground when you disagree with changes that lack substantial reasoning

In professional environments, design decisions should be based on research, user needs, and business requirements - not personal preferences. While compromise is necessary, arbitrary changes without legitimate reasons shouldn't be the norm!!

I think to give good advice here, we need to understand the group dynamics and how you guys worked together. In real life, there are multiple stakeholders involved, UX, dev, product, and executives. You can never just design on your own and simply hand it off to the dev. They will most certainly reject it for a variety of reasons. I usually involve everyone early on, from idea phrase to production. I take their ideas, feedback, and incorporate those into my work so that everyone can see themselves in the design and reasonate with it. It's not just my design but our design if that makes sense.

post_1kdqit1,,post,userexperience,Has anyone built text-heavy learning tools?  What's the best way to do this?,"Hi all, I have a UX question in the broadest sense. I'm building a ""scenario based"" learning tool for people to improve their organisational judgement using real life situations.  At the moment I've focused just on assembling the scenarios (description, supporting links, and answer).   Screenshot here (it's extremely early MVP):

https://preview.redd.it/oepxsfj6ujye1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=a915015523915cf79d0bb4c9b454e133c7c907af

The issue I have is that this is a tonne of information to consume.  Read a description, click links to read more descriptions,  type your long form answer, get another long form answer and easily ends up being 10-15 pages per scenario.  I could shorten the scenarios a bit, write them more succinctly, but the reality is the situations are complex and the context is really important (it's the whole point).

How should I be thinking about simplifying / making this more palatable? Looking for more of a high level user experience, not just a ""split the answer up behind a 'read more' modal"" or something.  Here's what I've considered so far:

* Video, obviously.  Put the answer into a video so that removes at least one text element.
* I considered doing something like Duolingo with bite sized questions or asking individual questions and showing a checkmark when you complete each one (which I think is a good idea) but the scenarios are complex, you still need to consume all of the context.  I could go through and select all the relevant parts from the links, and show you 6-7 snippets, but part of the exercise is identifying those aspects yourself.
* Making it like a ""detective"" game where it imports the text of the article natively and you go over it with a highlighting tool and later it scores you on what you identified (so you still have to read all the text, but at least it's interactive).

  
Would appreciate your thoughts.  Links to examples etc would be brilliant.  Thanks a lot and have a great weekend!

comment_mqdfy7r,post_1kdqit1,comment,userexperience,,"I wonder if breaking up the flow would help somewhat - right now it seems like a user would do all the reading up front, then process and write about it at the end. The other options you considered seem to be trying to break it up too. So maybe the solution is something that brings a balance between all your ideas.

If I were to tackle this, I would probably suggest users tackle 1 article at a time and provide them a way to either take notes or highlight sections. Then ask your final long-form question and pull in their notes/highlights so far as reference. This way they're encouraged to engage with each article and build up relevant quotes/notes to help them craft their final answer.

Interesting problem you have here. Best of luck!",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/1kdqit1/has_anyone_built_textheavy_learning_tools_whats/mqdfy7r/,2025-05-03T14:08:20+00:00

3. Is the suggestion meant to make development easier, faster, or reduce their workload? I get that, and I’m happy to discuss what might help dev, but my job is to advocate for a UX that users actually want to use. Otherwise, who are you even coding for?
4. Appeal to higher authority. Sometimes UX and Dev reach an impasse were one teams ideal scenario harms the other teams goals. That’s when higher levels of management need to decide how to prioritize company resources and who gets the joy of extra work.

comment_mogjilt,post_1k59k6i,comment,userexperience,,"I'd almost always involve devs during design stage to prevent this... Although its not always possible, due to not having enough time, lack of interes etc. (which you will have to manage) but the earlier they involve and discuss the design path you're taking, the easier would be to handle these issues down the line. 

it takes a bit of skill to ensure you are still driving the design, but having them involved in the process helps few things; some devs actually very smart and have great ideas, which can help you. Also they might know technical constraints that you were not aware (specially when dealing with complex systems). 

negative side of it, is if you lose control of the process, and it becomes a design critique by devs, conversation can become painful. 

Check their sprint plan, look what features you're developing, make sure you're ahead at least 2-3 sprints on your designs, arrange once weekly calls to show the progress (wireframe/idea/journey etc.) ask their opinion. Discuss the idea, show examples, whatever you need to make to create a positive conversation. 

They may not engage or interested in the first place, but keep pushing it, find couple of devs who are interested in, create a good relationship with them. 

If there is not a clear hand-off, or approval process for designs (ie going through the Product team first) then this needs to be fixed, as you might be making decisions on the design but PO or someone from Business/Stakeholders should still approve the solution - this means both design and technical. In this case, involve your project manager, dev lead etc. with product and design leads to look at the process.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/1k59k6i/tips_on_pushing_back_against_developer_design/mogjilt/,2025-04-22T16:54:34+00:00

You solve this by building better trust with your team.

If their suggestions are bad or inappropriate, then respectfully help them understand what the better alternative is and why, all the while treating their opinions as valid and worth listening to and understanding as well.

Then, they’ll respect you, and even stand up for you and advocate for you.

post_1dxraob,,post,codingbootcamp,[➕Moderator Note] Promoting High Integrity: explanation of moderation tools and how we support high integrity interactions in this subreddit.,"UPDATED 4/20/2025 with the latest tool options available (some were added and removed by Reddit), as they have changed recently.

Hi, all. I'm one of the moderators here. I wanted to explain how moderation works, openly and transparently as a result of a recent increase in Reddit-flagged 'bad actors' posting in this subreddit - ironically a number of them questioning the moderation itself. You won't see a lot of content that gets flagged as users, but we see it on the moderator side.

Integrity is number one here and we fight for open, authentic, and transparent discussion. The Coding Bootcamp industry is hard to navigate - responsible for both life changing experiences and massive lawsuits for fraud. So I feel it's important to have this conversation about integrity. We are not here to steer sentiment or apply our own opinioins to the discussion - the job market was amazing two years ago and terrible today, and the tone was super positive two years ago and terrible today.

# REDDIT MODERATION TOOLS

1. Ban Evasion Filter: This is set to high - in Reddit's words: ""The ban evasion filter uses a variety of signals that flag accounts that may be related. These signals are approximations and can include things like how the account connects to Reddit and information they share with us.""
2. Reputation Filter: In Reddit's words: ""Reddit's reputation filter uses a combination of karma, verification, and other account signals to filter content from potential spammers and people likely to have content removed."". We have this set to a higher setting than default.
3. Crowd Control: This feature uses AI to collapse comments and block posts from users that have negative reputations, are new accounts, or are otherwise more likely to be a bad actor. This is set to a higher than default setting.

# DAY-TO-DAY MODERATION

1. A number of posts and comments are automatically flagged by Reddit for removal and we don't typically intervene. Note that some of these removals appear to be ""removed by Reddit"" and some appear to be ""removed by Moderators"". There are some inconsistencies right now in Reddit's UI and you can't make assumptions as a user for why content was removed.
2. We review human-reported content promptly for violation of the subreddit rules. We generally rely on Reddit administrators for moderation of Reddit-specific rules and we primarily are looking for irrelevant content, spammy, referral links, or provable misinformation (that is disproved by credible sources).
3. We have a moderator chat to discuss or share controversial decisions or disclose potential bias in decisions so that other mods can step in.
4. We occasionally will override the Reddit Moderation Tools when it's possible they were applied incorrectly by Reddit. For example, if an account that is a year old and has a lot of activity in other subs was flagged for a ""Reputation Issue"" in this sub, we might override to allow comments. New accounts (< 3 months old) with little relevant Reddit activity should never expect to be overriden.
5. If your content is being automatically removed, there is probably a reason and the moderations might not have access to the reasons why, and don't assume it's an intentional decision!

# WHAT WE DON'T DO...

1. We do not have access to low level user activity (that Reddit does have access to for the AI above) to make moderation decisions.
2. We don't proactively flag or remove content that isn't reported unless it's an aggregious/very obvious violation. For example, referral codes or provably false statements may be removed.
3. We don't apply personal opinions and feelings in moderation decisions.
4. We are not the arbiters of truth based on our own feelings. We rely on facts and will communicate the best we can about the basis for these decisions when making them.
5. We don't remove ""bad reviews"" or negative posts unless they violate specific rules. We encourage people to report content directly to Reddit if they feel it is malicious.
6. We rarely, if ever, ban people from the subreddit and instead focus on engaging and giving feedback to help improve discussion, but **all voices need to be here to have a high integrity community, not just the voices we want to hear.**

# QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

1. Ask in this comment thread, message a mod, or message all the mods!
2. Disagree with decisions? The moderators aren't perfect but we're here to promote high integrity and we expect the same in return.

post_1k9dlh6,,post,codingbootcamp,"Wall Street Journal: Prompt Engineering is already ""obsolete"" as job (link in body). This is an important indicator how fast the market is changing and why you need to be extremely skeptical of ""Gen AI"" and bootcamps pivoting from SWE to AI.","[https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hottest-ai-job-of-2023-is-already-obsolete-1961b054](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hottest-ai-job-of-2023-is-already-obsolete-1961b054)

While the headline sounds bad, the article discusses all of the other AI-related jobs that are in-demand, but the overall lesson is to be super careful about pivoting too quickly into ""AI"" - both for students and for bootcamps.

RE: Prompt engineering ""It was an expertise all existing employees can be trained on"" according to one source in the article.

Instead of being completely doom and gloom, I want to explore ideas and solutions. Unfortunately, these all have problems, but I'm trying to show that I'm looking at this thoughtfully and not just dooming and glooming.

**SOLUTION ATTEMPT 1: Bootcamp pivots to ""Gen AI"" bootcamp instead of SWE bootcamp**

I would be extremely critical and look into detail what exactly you are paying for, because I suspect a lot of SWE bootcamps - faced with crashing enrollment - will take advantage of people's interest in AI and offer these AI courses.

The problem is 

1. lack of expertise in the people teaching and creating the materials. 

2. AI makes it possible to generate the materials themselves now, so why pay thousands of dollars for this!

3. Everything changes so fast that what you do will be obsolete.

I could see a world where a free or $100 AI course is offered and $1000 of mentorship can be added on for personal guidance or something, but charging $10K, $20K for an AI bootcamp is crazy right now.

**SOLUTION ATTEMPT 2: Bootcamp teaches ""general capacities/non-specific skills"" that will ""apply to every job"".**

The other option for a failing bootcamp is to not teach any specific technical skills and instead focusing on teaching you ""how to learn"" or how to ""problem solve"".

I think this is more promising, but ultimately this is what college was always meant to do and it doesn't directly lead to a job at the end.

*If I spend 10 weeks intensively building problem solving skills, why does that make me a hirable engineer?*

Maybe such a course is like a part time $200 type learning and development type course, but is this something you pay $23,000 for??!? No.

**CONCLUSION**

The 12-16 week SWE bootcamp  is dead. What comes next? Well AI is moving too fast for anyone to know for sure, and what works today might not work tomorrow.

On the other hand, there is a lot of room much cheaper and less job-related courses and programs to come out.

Spending $2000 for 12 weeks to learn generative AI skills with accountability you can't get with ChatGPT? Maybe.

But when bootcamps spend thousands of dollars to acquire you as a student (THIS IS AN ACCURATE FIGURE) then the bootcamp model doesn't really work for this. It's more of a MOOC model.",25,https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/1k9dlh6/wall_street_journal_prompt_engineering_is_already/,2025-04-27T20:26:23+00:00
comment_mpe7khd,post_1k9dlh6,comment,codingbootcamp,,"Nothing has really changed regarding the existence of AI tools. Let me explain:

Low-code and No-code solutions have been around for decades. Remember Access forms? FoxPro? We used to write HTML and CSS by hand, now there are Wordpress, Wix, and others. As tools and technology improve, some skills move ""downstream"". I wouldn't pay SWE rates for basic websites, and neither should anyone else.

Now, we just went through a big boom cycle where employers needed basic skills and needed them fast. This meant the minimum bar for a while was ""reasonably smart, can communicate, and can wire up a CRUD app using a web framework"".

Now here comes AI. Is it replacing skilled developers? No. Not even close. But it is putting upward pressure on the bar for skills. I can one-shot pretty much all low-complexity React components because I know what I'm doing.

Now, like Michael, I talk to hiring managers all the time (I do a lot of L&D consulting). I had a meeting with a fortune 500 hiring manager the other day and he was RANTING about how shit the CS grads in their applicant pool are. They've been using AI too early in the learning journey and don't understand anything. This particular hiring manager was saying top program CS grads can't describe how to handle exceptions, don't know the difference between HTTP and HTTPS, and a litany of other fundamentals.

My take on what's happening right now is that employers want people with strong fundamentals, strong debugging skills, and strong design skills. They want people who can leverage AI as an assistant, not as a crutch. Because if you lack fundamentals and all you do is ""prompting"", as the hiring manager said, ""I will ship that job to Southeast Asia, because you provide no value other than typing prompts into a keyboard"".

\---

The idea of accelerated training isn't dead. However, the bar for what is considered an entry/junior-level developer is rising.  I see the rise of 6 to 18-month programs that cover more foundational skills. This means the price is going to go up, not down and the people who just want to blow through and try to make a quick buck are going to get pushed out of the space.

I kinda think this is a good thing.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/1k9dlh6/wall_street_journal_prompt_engineering_is_already/mpe7khd/,2025-04-27T23:08:58+00:00
comment_mpq2e9i,post_1k9dlh6,comment,codingbootcamp,,"I think the problem with the AI conversation is that we're always comparing ""*AI*"" to people who *don't know how to code* \- (and don't have the mindset in place) - or Jr. devs (*the kind that are barely useful to start and will take years to level up to basic tasks*).

So, if we're comparing against people who can't write *ANY* code... (or people who are doing basic data entry and small HTML fixes) --- YES!!! *AI IS AMAZING* AND IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR JOB!!! (*meaning it will not leave room for as many rote tasks/and tasks you likely wouldn't have done anyway*).  I can ask Claude or whatever to go in there and write a bunch of code for me. BUT -- it's only specific types of tasks that end up working out well. Need to cross-reference a data point in 10 files and make sure they're in sync? Need to add descriptions to your list of options? Need to write some standard CRUD tests? Great. Search, find and replace, copying things. It can do that!

But - I have to say -- as someone who's been working on designing and building a whole app (with a small team) over the last 3 months...  ""AI"" isn't doing what people seem to think it will.

Overall, I'd say that ClaudeCode, Cursor, (anything you can throw at it) (and I'm assuming you know all about architecture and you could write the code to an intermediate level) -- *it's not faster*... It's not *better*... and I'd say it's a *net loss* for the team as a whole. We used this project as a way to thoroughly test the latest and greatest offerings. In some cases - I really was convinced that we'd reached a meaningful threshold. I had Claude build out a whole CRUD feature for FAQs based on the patterns that were in place already (and it's a well-known and well documented framework without too much churn). There were *several* things that truly impressed me. But... as weeks went by... things began to change. I knew less about the codebase because I wasn't in there as often. Many of the times / the AI would *completely* lose the plot and cause way more hours of wasted time. Cross-team communication was worse. Even the non-coder type people end up doing too much in ChatGPT and losing the deeper connection to the product, the decision-making, and the *mindset* (context) you need to *make good things*.

AI might take your job if you're a barely useful --- but ""AI"" - (*even the best models - applied with expertise*) (I spent hundreds of dollars / not just free mode) -- are like a really good programmer (As in experienced in common crud codebases) -- but they're *high*, *tired*, *half-deaf* \-- *and have no long-term memory*. It's basically worse than teaching a Jr. programmer. And -- I didn't *want* this to be the case. I don't care about writing code. I like building things. But it's true. And anyone who wants to get together and have me show them -- I'll do it. (and there are documentation/encyclopedia/talking through architecture patterns that LLMs can do that are totally a big value / for the right person) (so, I'm not saying LLMs aren't astonishing here)

2. AI as a new coding paradigm. What if AI Agents write and maintain their own services and we don't really know or care how it's written. Right now we need AI to write code humans understand so we can integrate it and evaluate it. What if instead there is an AI system that takes a spec and builds a standalone system that fulfills the promised API and maintains it as the spec changes.

post_1kg4wfb,,post,cscareerquestions,Nobody is hiring but yet all I see are SWE job postings,"Hey everyone,

So I’ve been hearing the same thing over and over again: “No one is hiring,” “The job market is dry,” “Even juniors with experience are getting ghosted.”

But then I go on job boards, LinkedIn, or even clearances-focused sites, and all I see are software engineering roles — many of them remote or requiring a security clearance. It’s making me wonder:

Are companies just posting jobs without actually hiring? Or are they hiring, but just being extremely selective and slow about it?

I’m asking because I’m literally just starting my journey into software engineering and will most likely have 4 YOE by the time I even graduate. So while this may not impact me right now, I’m trying to understand the landscape and where the demand actually exists.

For those actively applying or on the hiring side — what’s the real deal in the market right now?

Appreciate the insight.

It's both. There is an epidemic of [ghost jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_job). There are also far more candidates for jobs than there are open positions.

Then my next job gave me the option. I asked what most of the team was using, and they said most people use a Mac... so I said what the hell, and went with a Mac. Everything went so much smoother having the same device as my team members, *especially* onboarding.

I've done that at every job since. If I'm given the choice, I ask what most of the team is using, and go with that.

comment_mqsw405,post_1kfqhqx,comment,cscareerquestionsCAD,,"Graduating with no co-ops or internships is definitely rough in this current market, if you leverage some of your school projects and sell it off as your ""own"", you should still be able to get some interviews after a couple dozen applications. Like you said yourself, the two issues is: 

1. Consistency (mass apply, apply out of your city - CRITICAL, excel in the leetcode style interviews)

2. Work experience

I would say there is no point in doing a masters if your goal is purely money. With the 2+ years and money you spend on a masters program, you can find a small/medium sized company to start working and building your YoE then leapfrogging. You would definitely be a more attractive candidate than a masters student with a few months of co-op. 

  
If you do enjoy schooling/research, then definitely stick with one of first 3 options you picked. Are you trying to go for a course based masters or a research masters? Depending on what you pick, your undergrad GPA and extracurriculars/research will be more important. From my personal experience w/ several of my friends now finishing their research masters and starting their PhD at UofT, having several professors, lecturers, etc bat for you is significantly more important than a good undergrad GPA. 2-3 strongly written letters from professors that have seen your dedication from either attending office hours, living in the computer labs, or participating in groups like UTMIST or GDSC will be a huge boon. You can also disregard all qualifications if you can get a professor to agree to be your research advisor. 

Also, not sure if this changed from when I was looking at the masters program at UofT as a backup plan, but the co-op was not guaranteed and you're still on the hook for maintaining strong discipline to apply, interview, and maintain your studies at the same time.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/1kfqhqx/thinking_about_getting_my_masters_new_grad/mqsw405/,2025-05-06T00:18:54+00:00

One of the comments recommends going into a different role then moving up into a role you like. I agree with this and it’s exactly how I got my role. But you do need to network quite a bit (within the company) to move up.

comment_mquanvk,post_1kf5jrp,comment,cscareerquestionsCAD,,"two weeks is absolutely doable! I was in a similar spot not long ago - had to rush system design prep while still grinding leetcode and working.

for starting from scratch, focus on these:

1. get the core patterns + terminology down ASAP (load balancers, caching, DB types, replication vs sharding etc)

2. practice a mock DAILY if u can - wat kills most candidates is the communication/structure, not technical knowledge. record urself if u cant find partners

3. make sure u actually ask clarifying qs before just diving in (biggest red flag in these interviews)

most underrated approach imo: find ppl who've interviewed at this specific company for mock sessions. Each big tech has slightly different expectations for system design (some care more abt APIs vs scalability vs code details etc). 

for sde2 level, they're mostly looking for solid fundamentals + reasonable tradeoff decisions, not crazy optimizations. They want someone who can articulate WHY they chose certain components rather than just throwing buzzwords around.

If ur struggling to find quality feedback, theres some good platforms where actual senior engineers who've conducted these interviews can do mocks with u - they usually give WAY better feedback than random youtube videos. the recs in that other comment are solid. check prepfully interviewingio",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/1kf5jrp/preparing_for_first_ever_system_design_interview/mquanvk/,2025-05-06T05:58:32+00:00

post_1kenfzz,,post,cscareerquestionsCAD,Backend Dev Considering DevOps Switch — Not Sure if It’s the Right Long-Term Move,"
Hey all,

I’m a backend developer with about 3 years of experience, working mostly with Java (17), Spring Boot, Kafka, Gradle, and microservices architecture. I’ve done a mix of CRUD-heavy work and some exposure to high-level design, message-driven systems, and basic scalability topics. But lately, I’ve been feeling like the work is getting repetitive, and I’m not growing as fast as I’d like.

An internal DevOps opportunity opened up, and I’m debating whether to make the switch. The role includes:
-Managing CI/CD pipelines, observability, and security checks
-Writing automation scripts in Python, Bash, and Ansible
-Working with Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes
-BUT: No real cloud or IaC (AWS/Terraform is handled by a separate infra team but there’s chance for openTofu) 
-Occasional internal tool development

Here’s what I’m unsure about:
-Would switching to this DevOps role help me grow faster, or would I just trade CRUD work for support work?

-Should I stay in backend and aim for more technical depth (architecture, scaling, cloud-native dev), or branch out?

-I’m not 100% sold on becoming a platform/cloud engineer — I’m also considering a path into technical management or leadership down the road.

-I also want to eventually increase my earnings, possibly through contracting or freelance, and want to keep my skillset relevant and AI-resistant.

Anyone been in a similar situation? I’d love to hear from people who’ve stayed in backend vs those who switched to DevOps — and what it led to long term.

Thanks in advance for any insight.

How would you like to grow -- staying more on the backend side (depth) or try out devops (breadth)? I think this is a good guiding question. I had the same opportunity at 2 YoE and decided against it because I wanted to do more depth as a backend dev. It's a hard balance :( 

My current company (team?) is much more greenfield compared to my previous company and I've had to work a lot with devops people to set up databases, roles, etc, even as a backend engineer.

**Rust:** Rust language seems to be getting more popular and similar to C++.

comment_mqdpso1,post_1kdurx2,comment,cscareerquestionsCAD,,"Just asking this question alone is already a good sign.

A good mentee is one that communicates _regularly_, which implies a consistent cadence, and is neither ""too much"" nor ""too infrequently"".

For example, as a mentor, there are two things that make a mentee difficult to deal with:

- Frequent questions at random intervals with little context
- Radio silence (which makes me assume maybe they are struggling but too nervous to speak up or ask)

To me, the best thing a mentee could do would be to send an update on a regular basis describing exactly how things are going.  Maybe once a day.  Could definitely be less once you are comfortable enough that you can operate independently.

If everything is going good, the update can be a sentence or two describing how things are going on whatever your working on, and if nothing else just help to keep your mentor in the loop and reduce any concern they may have that you could be struggling in silence.

If you are stuck, make sure to include as many details about exactly what you're stuck on including a list of everything you've tried to solve it.  This serves two purposes, one to show that you've put a bit of effort in yourself and give your mentor an idea of where your thought process is at so they can help, the other is to reduce the amount of unknowns and context shifts they have to do to in order to get up to speed and help you.

There's a fine balance to be struck with wanting to learn and figure things out on your own, while still making sure to avoid spinning your wheels.  My general rule of thumb is that if you've gone more than 2 focused hours of attention on something and made absolutely zero progress, that's the time to reach out with a good summary of what you've tried and whether a mentor might be able to gently guide you toward the solution without just giving the answer.

Also make sure to request at least 1-2 synchronous (e.g. a call if remote, or in person if not) 1:1's per week, and make sure that you prepare in advance the topics that you want to learn more about or things that are valuable to you.

The pay isn't terrible, but since I'm dealing with a lot of compliance stuff, I spend more time documenting than doing. So I'm trying to get a new Dev Leader position somewhere, something along the lines of what I'm doing, but *out* of the finance world.

Landed an interview at Ansys, Lead R&D Engineer, which is pretty much what I do, tick all the boxes. First non-technical recruit screener shot me down, I suspect because I'm not enough of a developer...

  
Do I interview that badly or is it the stench of the financial industry? How do I get out of this.

comment_mq9u3q2,post_1kdao4s,comment,cscareerquestionsCAD,,"""Finance"" is a spectrum:

- Quant firms and hedge funds are prestigious and high-paying.
- Next comes most fintechs - moderately prestigious and well paid.
- Banks, insurance, and gov't occupy the lowest tier in most people's minds. 😬

There's a stereotype (justified or not) that banks do not cultivate high performing software devs. You will have to buck that belief by showing strong projects on your resume (either work related or personal) that demonstrate leadership or technical ability and then interview strongly to seal the deal.

post_1kd05lr,,post,cscareerquestionsCAD,Should i take this offer at Autodesk?,"I received an offer recently for swe 2 at Autodesk. My goal in the next 3 years is to be in big tech preferably Google, Netflix, Apple. Please help me pick!!

Autodesk:
115k base
10k usd per year rsu
8% bonus

Total ~137k CAD @ 3 yoe. 

Im at RBC right now and my TC is essentially the same (134k). 

I like RBC, I like my work, and the company and my particular team seems highly stable and secure. People assume banks do shitty work but I really have been doing highly interesting work that hiring managers at many companies were interested in. I also really like my colleagues.


The Autodesk team on the other hand works at a large scale (it's swe position for one of the platform teams). It's going to be a departure from the product engineering work I love but might still be something I enjoy. 

Autodesk is also remote. Which is good.

I don't know if having autodesk on my resume will make any differences since it isn't big tech even though it is a great software company.

post_o4udai,,post,userexperiencewriting,How did you get into UX writing?,"Hi,

Thanks to a post on the other UX writing sub I thought I'd join here :)

I've been working freelance for the last 5 years doing a mix of writing (content writing/copywriting/journalism) and a little bit of marketing. I'm looking to potentially make the switch to UX writing.

I've read a couple of books and done some online research and it seems much more up my street than long-form writing (which for various reasons is starting to drive me mad). At first I thought maybe I'd do a course, but I'm finding it hard to determine if the ones I keep stumbling across are worth the high price tag (one article I found even suggested I do a $10k UX program...)

How did you get into UX writing? Did you do a course, or did you create a portfolio and just start applying? If you created a portfolio from scratch, did you come up with concept projects? If not, how did you approach it?

Perhaps take a look at the UX Writers Collective. I can recommend them, in spite of their somewhat high prices. They also have a cheaper course that acts like an introduction to the field.

You can also find a mentor on UX Coffee Hours. I'm sure they will be most helpful.

If you're searching online, and reading articles, you can basically treat UX writing as any other UX role.

post_nzqcm2,,post,userexperiencewriting,Email content tip #1 - Do not cross 102 KB,"When working on product emails, we focus on the content. But make sure the email size is less than or equal to 102 KB. 

**Why?** 

Emails more than 102 KB are clipped by Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook. Meaning, only half the email is visible. Readers have to click **View entire message button** to access the other half of the content. 

This will affect the engagement and most importantly the experience. Useful CTAs and info could be hidden under a click.

**How to prevent it?**

Speak with the developer who is working on the email and ask them to double-check. If it crosses the limit then devs can help you bring it under 102 KB.

post_1kemaz1,,post,bootcamp,"Connects to network, no internet in Windows 10","I have my 2018 MacBook Pro set up to boot to Windows 10 from a USB SSD.

It's worked flawlessly for over two years until yesterday Windows froze on start up, and it was impossible to fix through any of the basic options in  the Windows repair tool (wouldn't boot to safe mode, couldn't roll back updates or go back to an earlier restore point) however I could use the tool to reinstall Windows 10.

I selected to keep my files but upon restarting all the installed software was gone, which made sense. My user account and files were preserved and it remembered my WiFi connections from the previous installation.

However, while it would connect to the network, it said ""no internet connection""

I tried the obvious steps first:

1. connect to a completely different network (I set my phone up as a wireless hotspot and disconnected it from my WiFi) - it connected to the adapter but no internet (same as my home network)

2. I connected a USB WiFi adapter, and tried both networks (same problem)

3. I switched back to macOS, downloaded the latest bootcamp assistant drivers, and when back in Windows ran the tool (no change) and then checked it was using those drivers (it was) and even uninstalled the drivers for the WiFi card and manually reinstalled using the drivers in the download (no change)

4. I pinged 8.8.8.8 in command prompt and found it was receiving a response, so I manually configured the network adapter to use 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1 as DNS and this did cause a change, Windows switched from saying no internet, to connected. However no practical change was observed, the DNS would not resolved and the network adapter reported no usage (well 6MB total which I'm assuming were just the DNS requests)

At various stages I tried deactivating the windows firewall completely (no changes) and tried to configure Edge to use 1.1.1.1 for DNS (I can't download any other browser as I can't connect to the internet)

I also made sure there was no VPN or proxy interfering and from what I can tell from the 3 different windows control panels, this is not the case.

I'm perplexed by the problem, it does not seem to be hardware (two different network adapters tried, and my MacBook WiFi card works fine in macOS) - it isn't network (tried two independent networks) and Windows is a fresh install (and I have rerun the Bootcamp set up after reinstalling in case windows had reverted to one with no bootcamp software)

The only thing I can think is that because some settings were copied over from before the wipe that there is some registry conflict or similar responsible.

I did have the Nord VPN client installed prior to the wipe (that software was wiped with the reinstall) and I have gone through the network settings and can't see any of its fingerprints interfering anywhere, however it's the only thing I can think of that could be interfering but have no clue where else to look.

Any ideas (either relating to VPN settings or something else)

Many thanks in advance.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bootcamp/comments/1kemaz1/connects_to_network_no_internet_in_windows_10/,2025-05-04T15:20:54+00:00
post_1ke8915,,post,bootcamp,Been 3 days trying to install Windows in my MacBook Pro 2018,"Okay so I have a 15inch MacBook Pro, 2018 32gb RAM, 500gb SSD, with Sonoma 14.7.5 and I’ve been trying to install windows in this device for 3 days.

1st try:
- At first, my MacBook Pro was in Sequoia 15.3, and tried to download windows 10 through bootcamp. It always failed with an ImageInstall error message.

2nd try:
- Tried to install windows 10 though a bootable USB (ExFat) by copying over the files from the iso into the bootable usb. During install step in the windows installer, there’s no partition files visible (see image 1)

3rd try:
- Tried to install windows again through a bootable usb but this time, I erased my usb in Fat32 format and used wimlib. Still the same issue I faced in 2nd try.

4th try:
- I tried to install windows 11 by downloading the iso. Copied over all the files from it into my ExFat formatted usb. Then I added BypassTPMCheck, BypassRAMCheck and BypassSecureBootCheck in regedit to bypass win11 security checks. Then it looked promising as as I was able to see my drives. I selected my partitioned drive, deleted it so it went to unallocated space, selected it, and the installer started to work. Then it reached around 74% and then showed an error (see image 2). Quite a helpful error.

5th, 6th, 7th, 8th try:
- I downgraded my MacBook to Sonoma from Sequoia as I read that the latest version of Bootcamp might have messed with windows drivers. Went through both step 1 to 4 individually and I faced the same errors that I did previously for each tried.

9th try (final one, and now I give up):
- I’ve tried different disk partition formats to see if that was the issue with my windows 10 usb installation method. Tried APFS, MacOS Extended Journaled, ExFat for my windows boot drive and even then I couldn’t install windows 10 (partitioned drive is not being recognized). I also tried to include drivers from Bootcamp in one try and Bombardier in another to see if I can use the “load drivers” function, but it throws an error saying “no signed drivers” were recognized in the scanned paths.

post_1kgasln,,post,cscareerquestionsEU,Google - Getting no team matching calls in the UK,"Hi All, 
   I completed my tech rounds back in February, 2025 and was informed by my recruiter (3rd part that Google works with) that I was being moved to the team matching phase. It's been 2 months that I have been waiting but no team matching calls yet. 

   Are there no more positions open for Software Engineer (L4) in the UK ? What should I do now ? Should I continue to wait or ask my recruiter to look in other countries? 

The reason I genuinely don't want to look for in other countries is that I am on a Skilled Worker Visa in the UK and have completed 3 years and want to get my ILR first.

post_1kgexaz,,post,cscareerquestionsEU,CV review for a self taught Java Developer.,"[https://imgur.com/a/8e7sXKV](https://imgur.com/a/8e7sXKV)

A little bit of my background.  
I am a university dropout (I studied CS for one year before dropping out). Mostly self-learned in the field of java, some frontend frameworks like React.  
I've been working different jobs (in non-IT related fields) and developing my skills in my free time. I did some simple freelance tasks, but mostly the projects were my own and I was working alone.  
No professional experience.

I decided that this year is the year when I'm trying to get into IT industry for real, aiming to land an entry role as java developer or fullstack, since I do feel pretty okay doing React and JavaScript.  
I know that the resume isn't perfect due to my background, but I want you guys to tell me if what you can see there is at least close to what is expected from a Junior Java Developer candidate.

comment_mr1e8ya,post_1kgexaz,comment,cscareerquestionsEU,,"I see a lot of problems:
- Don't say you have 2 years of experience when you clearly don't
- Remove education completely. Completing just a year at university it's not an achievement; it's a red flag. You're self-taught and that's all
- Don't inflate the CV. For example, ""data visualization"", ""real systems"", etc doesn't mean anything. Only add specific technologies. What you could do is to add a section like: ""Monitoring: Grafana,...""
- Rename ""Experience"" to ""Projects"". Give more specific details and link them to your Github. Right now, everything seems either very vague or very simple.
- I'm not very sure about this, but you might include non-IT related experience to show that you're a career changer and not a lazy person",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/1kgexaz/cv_review_for_a_self_taught_java_developer/mr1e8ya/,2025-05-07T09:46:26+00:00
post_1kg05s9,,post,cscareerquestionsEU,Should I consider Google Warsaw?,"Hi, 2 months ago I passed my technicals for an L3 role(4yoe) in Google Munich.

I am currently in Warsaw in another big tech, and chose Munich mainly because it is much closer to home (5hr drive) and Warsaw is not well connected to my home country so going home for weekends to visit family is a pain in the ass.

So after 1.5 months in team matching and 0 calls I am starting to consider Warsaw as well but I am worried because:
1. Will they even offer me a salary larger than my current salay?(60k).. levels.fyi range for Warsaw L3 is like from 50k to 100k so I have no idea
2. I am scared that I will end up in some legacy/non important project where I will be basically not able to develop skills or work on anything interesting. This is the case in my current position and is one large reason why I want to switch jobs ASAP. 
3. Warsaw winters are toooo harsh for me, this winter made me borderline want to jump off a balcony(that’s only partially a joke.)

I have been really wanting to go back to working in some smaller, more dynamic companies because this corporate world is tough, but I can not land a single interview, these companies mostly only want people with like 10 years of experience, so I guess I have to keep grinding…

So, Im 35 years old and worked in advertising as a copywriter for around 8 years. I know a little about design from working with art directors and am currently learning the google certificate UXD program that will teach me Figma. I don't see myself wanting to be in advertising anymore and really want to transition. At this age, to transition careers seems really scary and want to minimise mistakes. Can someone tell me what's the ideal path to be able to go from being a copywriter to a small business owner to a digital product designer? Should I be studying Industrial design? UX design? Interaction Design? I am ok with taking loans to study an MA program if required. I know everyone's going to say it is a saturated market, and I understand that. But I'd love guidance on:

1. Best way to transition from being a copywriter to digital product designer?

2. How to be more hireable as a beginner? Should I learn to be an interaction designer? SHould I be learning AI? If yes, any courses you may suggest?

3. Would my past experience of being a copywriter for 8 years and a small business owner for 5 years hold as any experience at all?

comment_mqw7yfm,post_1kg1z51,comment,UserExperienceDesign,,"I recommend going on ADPList and finding a few mentors there willing to deep dive with these.

1.	We like to be tool agnostic but right now the hotness is Figma. Sketch, XD, even Illustrator and Photoshop have been used though. If you go more to the no-code side of things you’ll get to tools like Rive and Framer.
2.	this is a very big question that you can Google fairly easily or ask someone in ADPList
3.	this isn’t a question, it’s a statement. Figma’s YouTube has good tool knowledge, and the Interactive design foundation has a lot of courses and free articles to help understanding.
4.	varies wildly. Typically the three major types of interview session are screener, behavioral, and design challenge. They maybe feature multiple rounds of each or no rounds of each depending.
5.	most of your competition will have degrees so at this point I’m seeing less certs getting hired like they were pre-pandemic
6.	personal networking, unfortunately. You will not get a UX job at a big company unless you network into it. Too many people applying.
7.	referrals by far. Look into networking, it’s not a quick or easy process, especially when you’re starting from zero.

post_1kgsuqr,,post,UX_Design,"What exactly are ""Design Problems"" and ""Design Solutions"" in UI/UX for Web and Mobile Apps?","I often hear terms like “design problems” and “design solutions” in YouTube videos, case studies, and articles about product design and UI/UX. While I do understand requirements and can design user flows based on them, I’m trying to get a clearer picture of what really qualifies as a “design problem” — especially in the context of web and mobile applications.



So here’s what I’m hoping to learn:



What exactly is considered a design problem in real-world projects?



How do you identify one?



Can you share some examples of design problems you’ve encountered in your work — and how you solved them through design?



If you've worked on products (even side projects) and tackled specific UI/UX issues, I’d love to hear about the problem → insight → solution journey.



Let’s make this a helpful thread for anyone learning product design beyond just wireframes and UI!

post_1kfp02k,,post,UX_Design,Screw Your UX: The Industry That Designed Its Own Collapse,"Yes, this is a rant. But it’s also a reckoning.

UX—once the golden child of tech—is unraveling. Not because of AI, not because of market shifts, but because the industry has whitewashed itself into creative paralysis. The field that claims to champion empathy has become a chaotic echo chamber of unchecked bias, aesthetic gatekeeping, and conceptual ambiguity.

Jobs are disappearing. Pay is shrinking. And the same white hands that once fetishized “human-centered design” now cling to AI-generated wireframes and regurgitated microcopy—safe, sterile, soulless. We’re not evolving. We’re retreating into the bland comfort of consensus-led design, where disagreement is feared more than mediocrity.

Ask ten UXers how to handle a dropdown or structure microcopy, and you’ll get ten performative think pieces—each one contradicting the last. Tables, grids, typography, tone—everyone’s an expert, but no one agrees. What was once artful collaboration has become semantic warfare.

And yet, a few still get it *mostly* right. What’s their secret? Proximity to power. The right face. The right accent. The privilege of being heard even when they're wrong.

So as the industry burns, let’s be honest: UX didn’t get gutted. It hollowed itself out, one whitewashed decision at a time.

And now we all get to live in the ruins it designed.",14,https://www.reddit.com/r/UX_Design/comments/1kfp02k/screw_your_ux_the_industry_that_designed_its_own/,2025-05-05T22:32:07+00:00

comment_mquskzw,post_1kfp02k,comment,UX_Design,,"The larger context is that UX is one input into the machine of producing products / services within a capitalist system. And within that system, the goal isn’t creativity in and of itself - it’s to sell more stuff faster than your competitors. That’s it. 

The recent wave of UX hit its peak during a decade plus of new tech (internet, mobile) that had unexplored questions around user behavior and interactions and a huge surface area of apps, websites, devices, etc. And with rock bottom interest rates coming out of the Great Recession, funding was incredibly cheap, allowing companies to hire people and speculate on all kinds of things, including new experiences.

But that’s slowed down as people have become more familiar with the technology and we’ve consolidated around a limited set of patterns, with some innovation around the edges. So from a business perspective, everyone’s focused on building fast from a standardized toolkit, leaving little room for exploring new interactions, visual systems, language, etc. And because we’ve hit a period of funding austerity (except for AI), everyone’s focused on whether a particular decision will increase revenue or cut costs. 

With AI, the goal is to take this existing knowledge and apply it even faster with fewer human inputs, not just from UX professionals but every single role in an organization. 

Ironically, we’re also victims of our own success. If any of you remember the weird internet of the 90s and early 2000s, it wasn’t just that patterns hadn’t been figured out - the internet was still a niche thing where you could get experimental and the stakes weren’t that high. Now everyone is anchored on the successful products of multi-billion dollar companies, including users who’ve become familiar with them, so if you’re trying to make it big, why do something radically different from a design perspective, especially if you could invest that time and money in other things that might grow the business?

So while we could point fingers at the humans working in the UX industry, I think it’s important to look at the structural things going on. Because of the tech boom, people forgot that their creativity is an input into a capitalist system, which is conditioned on whether that creativity generates revenue and maximizes shareholder value. That goes for UX as much as it does software engineering or any other role unfortunately.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UX_Design/comments/1kfp02k/screw_your_ux_the_industry_that_designed_its_own/mquskzw/,2025-05-06T09:06:46+00:00

comment_mqv031o,post_1kf8bxi,comment,UX_Design,,"Not everyone can read text when there is movement in their eyeline. Don't put the main message on a video. I think you need to make the 'where does the stuff go' more prominent. People who want to donate want to know this, and want to know how much of any money goes to charity and how much in expenses, salaries etc

All the rest of the stuff about 'super convenient' 'create impact' is just words that most people won't read.

The donor is thinking about donating, not making a booking. So make the CTA 'donate now'.

A site like this really should be a role model for accessibility [https://wave.webaim.org/aim/](https://wave.webaim.org/aim/)

I'm really confused by the pickup options. This is the first point where I realised there's a charge, so that needs to be addressed with a good rationale. And what does £xxx onwards mean? How do I know how much it will actually cost?

Then there's 'light pickup (via 2 wheeler)'. I don't know what that means. Are you picking up the stuff on a bicycle? Be much clearer.

Then on the flexi pickup there are some different choices, but I can't choose. Is this something I need to know? Don't I just tell you what I've got and you decide? How do I know how much my stuff weighs? What should I do if I don't know? 

It's literally unusable on mobile. No one is going to know what all the tiny poor contrast icons mean, and here's no way to find out on mobile.

What is 'organise donation drive' (and why is it spelled with a z - this is a UK site. There's no information, and it's not booking a pickup, so if I was actually looking for it I wouldn't find it.

'Drop yourself' is poor wording. 

Some of the questions above are answered on the next page. I'm not sure that this disaster of a page is needed at all - it could be addressed by having three options of 'arrange a pickup' 'drop off' 'organise a drive' which leads to you the relevant page with more detail.

When I choose drop off, explain why I need to list all the items. Why do I need to give my address? Don't ask if it's not necessary. Don't put 'free' here, it feels like it's taking the piss, as now it's me doing you the favour.

Hope that helps.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UX_Design/comments/1kf8bxi/redesigning_the_donation_website_looking_for_user/mqv031o/,2025-05-06T10:23:11+00:00

comment_mqk7lyw,post_1kcwd60,comment,UI_Design,,What kinds of projects should I build? I’m moving from Front End Development to primarily UI design and am not sure if I should just make something up from scratch (like design a fake website?) or should I find something that I think could be designed better and build an “improved” design? My last job let me design the UI so I have some “production designs” on Figma already but not sure what else to showcase since everywhere is looking for multiple designs that have made it to production.,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UI_Design/comments/1kcwd60/getting_started_in_ui_design_career_questions/mqk7lyw/,2025-05-04T16:44:24+00:00

post_1kg1pgz,,post,UI_Design,I made a digital card game concept for fun,"Hey folks, so I had a dumb idea rattling around in my head for a while and instead of letting it die quietly, I opened Figma and ChatGPT to bring it to life. It’s a satirical Top Trumps-style card game featuring exaggerated business stereotypes from different industries. You could hypothetically play it online, trade cards, or print it out for maximum chaos during your next meeting. Will I develop it further? Nope. Should I have been working instead? Let’s not talk about that. Just wanted to share the concept with the community. Maybe it gives someone a chuckle or inspires you. Would love to hear what absurd archetypes you’d add!

As Reddit butchered the images and you couldn't read the texts on the cards, here are the high resolution versions: [https://imgur.com/a/xAvbWCe](https://imgur.com/a/xAvbWCe)",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UI_Design/comments/1kg1pgz/i_made_a_digital_card_game_concept_for_fun/,2025-05-06T11:06:01+00:00

post_1kg94tu,,post,UI_Design,App Icon review please: visual timer app,"Hi all!

I've got an iOS app (Autism Timer Visual Countdown) that provides a visual timer interface and is primarily geared toward young children, people with special needs and their caregivers. The app UI is very simple, which consists of a big red timer rectangle which turns from red to very light pink, top-to-bottom, as the timer runs.  See screenshot. The current app logo is a child-like hand-drawn hourglass. I've repeatedly heard that people can't tell it's an hourglass and don't think it indicates a timer.

App main screen:

I'm hoping to get some feedback on the app icon and possible replacements - or any other great ideas. 😀

post_1kg46ye,,post,UI_Design,What do you think of this?,Since there are so much colors. Do you think it is good from UI perspective. And if you don't agree what changes would you like to make? To be fair for me it kinda looks like a children app theme. I would have used a single color palette theme.

post_1kg2ce3,,post,UI_Design,UI Generator - Feedback,"It's kind of meta to ask for UI feedback on an AI UI generator interface (lol) but sign of the times folks, here we are! 

I've been exploring this concept where users can generate UI components through natural language prompts and I'd love any and all feedback

The tool works by letting you describe what you want (e.g.: ""A listings card like Airbnb"") and it generates the design. The two main screens I'd like to get feedback on

1. The initial generator page with a simple prompt input
2. A comparison view showing iterations side by side

Some notes:

* The input prompt has a subtle red border that only appears on hover/active state
* I'm curious about the layout and if the suggested prompts below the input field are helpful
* The comparison view shows different versions, but I'm wondering if the layout is intuitive
* This tool is meant to be for both for starting UI designers and more advanced UX/UI designers looking to test some concepts quickly (with AI) and compare versions side by side

What do you think works/doesn't work about this interface? Is the minimalist dark theme appropriate for a design tool? (Wanted to avoid having to manage designs for both light and dark mode, so I went with dark only). Any suggestions on improving the UX flow??

I did do mobile-first designs although i'm imagining this platform to be desktop-first at first (since it will be mainly built for professionals in the field) although not sure tbh. Guess that will be determined at a more advanced build stage. Thanks for any feedback!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UI_Design/comments/1kg2ce3/ui_generator_feedback/,2025-05-06T11:42:48+00:00

This is the first time I develop a video game and I'm a bit lost. I have shown a prototype to someone and she says that she doesn't like it the main menu because it looks like a menu done by a programmer (me).
