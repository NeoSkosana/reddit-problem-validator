post_1bvpwy8,,post,SaaS_Ventures,I've sold my 4th SaaS as a solopreneur. The backstory.,"I have great news, I sold my 4th SaaS product!

Userdesk, it’s an AI Chatbot platform for businesses I launched in June 2023 with a pre-launch and a subscription-based model a few weeks later.

This is my 4th exit since 2021.

2021 — I sold Iterspace pre-revenues (quite unusual, but it happened)
2023 — I sold Hivoe and Inboxs, two Twitter-related SaaS
2024 — I sold Userdesk

Each time, the context and the reasons to sell were completely different, as well as the process. Let’s see the context and the lessons learned with each one (so you can learn from them too).

## iterspace
I started working on Iterspace in 2019 with one of my former colleagues (designer). I built it on the side of my full-time job at that time, as a team lead / senior software engineer. We worked on it for a couple of years, more or less. During the COVID, I was working from home and the time I saved from commuting, was dedicated to it.

At the beginning of 2021, we launched on Product Hunt, we got 70 upvotes (not that much but we didn’t have any distribution channel at that time), but Giulio Michelon noticed it, he wanted to meet us (two Italians launching a cool SaaS? it’s quite unusual), and he connected us with the final buyer.

I have to say that we didn’t set clear goals since the beginning. I wanted to make a living out of my businesses, but for my co-founder that was not realistic.

So when the possibility of selling arrived, he was completely convinced of the decision.

That was my first exit ever, and the amount of money was astonishing for a product with no revenues, so I accepted the deal.

The product hand-off was quite painful, as I created all the cloud resources on AWS with my personal account, and it was not possible to migrate them to another account (weird). So they had to re-create the whole infrastructure with their AWS account, and it took some time.

From the next SaaS on, I learned to create accounts with dedicated email, so the hand-off takes as long as sending the credentials to the buyer. And that’s it.

## Hivoe & Inboxs
Very quickly, I had to sell these two Twitter-related products, due to the crazy new Twitter API pricing (from 0 to $42k/month). Thankfully, I was able to sell them to HypeFury, because the alternative was to shut down both of them—not a great deal.

The journey has been amazing, because since 2021 I started being active on Twitter daily, and that’s how I discovered some pain points related to DM management. The products were growing quite well (up to $4k MRR). It was shocking to sell them, especially for an unexpected reason.

Lesson learned: platform risk is real. Next time, I want to diversify more or avoid platform risk much more.

## Userdesk
There’s much more to say about the exit of Userdesk.

I started working on Userdesk after the crazy hype I’ve seen about AI Chatbots around February / March 2023. AI was even more hyped than now, and as a SaaS owner, the value provided was simply incredible.

The platform allows you to “train” an AI Chatbot using your website (and other sources) and embed a live AI chatbot on your website. Simple, yet so powerful for customer support.

I pre-launched it with a $69 lifetime deal, and I sold 20 licenses in 24 hours. That was a validation for me (but I was wrong). A month later, the product was live and public, but a very small percentage of the pre-sale users signed up and used it.

I was perplexed.

This is my explanation. At that time, I already had a good reputation on Twitter / X. This sometimes brings to impulsive purchase from people who follows and appreciates you. This is great, don’t get me wrong, but it leads to misleading validation results.

Also, the product was poorly positioned, it was not targeting a specific niche and I didn’t know exactly who I was targeting: SaaS products, IT agencies looking for AI Chatbot platforms to resell, coaching services, and many others very different from each other.

This is a problem. I didn’t know how to write the copy of my landing pages, which content to write for my blog, and so on.

At the same time, a large number of competitors were already present and arrived in the short future.

Plus, in the end, I didn’t feel a great founder product fit. I have built a community on Twitter/X of 20k followers, and almost nobody was in overlap with the target audience of Userdesk. This meant an extra effort for me to find new clients.

In December 2023 I launched my Next.js SaaS Boilerplate Shipped.club, and I loved working on it, and helping other developers and aspiring SaaS owners to achieve their goals. This fits much better with my expertise and values—it’s simply a better fit for me.

Lesson learned: founder product fit matters much more than I expected.

## What did go well?
I loved working with AI tech, and I think it has huge potential, now and in the future. It’s not a bubble. And who knows, maybe in the future I will work on an AI product again.

I found my customers mainly from AI directories. A lot of AI enthusiasts use them to discover new products, and it also brought a good domain rate, with very few blog posts written.

![Userdesk SEO](https://d2bzf0z2yzi3mc.cloudfront.net/articles_images/4th_saas_sold_1.jpeg)


One of the main differentiation factors of Userdesk over the competition had been the UI and UX. Many people told me it was the best they tried between similar products, and it made me proud of the skills I’ve built over time. I am a software engineer, not a designer, but I’ve built many SaaS products now and the effort on the UI and UX paid off.

MRR-wise, the journey had been quite slow, but still brought good results, $1.1k MRR it’s difficult to achieve in less than 12 months.

![Userdesk MRR](https://d2bzf0z2yzi3mc.cloudfront.net/articles_images/4th_saas_sold_2.jpeg)


If you’re wondering what’s the big spike in September, it’s an enterprise customer ($500/month) who subscribed. The fact the subscription plans start at $19/month up, it’s another explanation for the “rapid” increase in MRR.

I know I could have grown it much more with more marketing effort: positioning, content, social—but I still think I did the right thing with selling it, and I’ll focus more on Shipped.club and other SaaS products soon.

What’s the legal process for selling?
I used the platform Acquired for the first time to list my product. I got around 20 people potentially interested, and a couple of offers.

The process is: when you find a good offer, you sign a Letter of Intent between you and the buyer. It blocks you from accepting offers from other potential buyers.
In this period they do the due diligence on your product, you need to describe the technical aspects of your product and the business. And you can still negotiate on the final price.

If this phase goes well and everyone is happy, you sign an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) which is a contract that finalizes the exchange of assets of your product between you and the buyer, and it sets the payment method, amount, and date.

When you sign the APA, you’re done with the deal. The remaining part is the hand-off of the assets.

I hope this article was helpful and inspiring, even if a bit long.

post_1kcds8h,,post,Temporal,Activities to Actions Ratio,"Hi, I have e-commerce/bookings workflow which I am planning to run on Temporal Cloud. 

It is a straight forward order flow having 10 steps/activities associated with it (including warehouse). Since Cloud is priced in ""Actions"", I'm not as clear on what a typical ratio is from Steps/Activities to Actions. I know the real answer is ""it depends"" -- but I was looking for a rule of thumb for thinking about how my Activities will turn int to Actions, so I can get a better sense for my potential cost/month. 

TLDR: Is it 1 Activity is at usually 5 steps, 10 steps, 15 steps, etc.? Personal anecdotes here are appreciated",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temporal/comments/1kcds8h/activities_to_actions_ratio/,2025-05-01T17:00:43+00:00

post_1kb3j4q,,post,Temporal,Triggering Temporal workflows inside the DB transaction (a.k.a. the Outbox Pattern) – hands-on guide & real-world lessons,"You want to guarantee that the state of your database is consistent with work done by Temporal. There are many instances where this can be achieved by treating the Temporal workflow as the source of truth:

* Kick-off the workflow
* Update the database via actions
* Rely on Temporal's execution guarantees / retries

In practice, this means you can call `StartWorkflow` (or `SignalWithStart`) right after your `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` succeeds. In practice that leaves a scary gap: what if the app crashes between `COMMIT` and the SDK call or a script that bypasses your API forgets to call Temporal at all?

Many teams solve this with the **outbox pattern**—record the “event” in the same transaction that changes the business row, then use that event to trigger the Temporal workflow. Sounds simple; turns out it’s fiddly to build:

* You need reliable change-data-capture (CDC) on your database.
* You need catch idempotent workflow starts so duplicates collapse.
* You have to operate and monitor the relay to Temporal.

We first heard about this use case from developers using our tool ([Sequin](https://sequinstream.com)) to handle the CDC / outbox pattern and provide transactional temporal triggers. Their requests pushed us to document a cleaner path.

# When is the extra effort worth it?

When do you really need a transactional consistency. The most common we've seen is when multiple systems can potentially mutate a row in a database that needs to trigger another set of work. 

Think of deleting an account triggering workflow that removes access, purges other systems, or even truncates tables. No matter how the account is deleted, you always want that workflow to run.

Another example we saw from a customer was inventory tracking. The database is the ultimate source of truth for the inventory of a product. As soon as that hit's zero, they want other systems to no longer return the item in search results - and trigger re-ordering workflows.

# Wiring it together

To achieve a transactional guarantee, you'll:

1. **Outbox/CDC** – Capture the change to an outbox using either logical replication or a trigger (depending on your database).
2. **Stream relay** – A lightweight consumer reads the outbox and relays the work to temporal. Importantly, it only removes the item from the outbox once Temporal has picked it up.
3. **Idempotent start** – Relay calls `SignalWithStart` (or `StartWorkflow` with a deterministic ID) so retries collapse and Temporal workflows fire *exactly once*.

Because the DB itself emits the event, *any* writer—your app, a migration script, an admin console—automatically drives the workflow, closing the “committed-but-not-started” gap. 

# Try the full example

We put together a tutorial (Docker compose, Postgres ➜ Sequin ➜ Temporal) that walks through the pattern end-to-end using our open source project:

comment_mpwzdpn,post_1kb3j4q,comment,Temporal,,"I would argue that CDC isn't strictly _needed_ for outbox processing. You can easily have something that just polls the table and/or uses `LISTEN` to wake up on new inserts. While CDC is more elegant, it adds complexity.

I would also argue that if you do use CDC, a third-party solution like Sequin can also be overkill. The Postgres logical replication protocol, for example, is very simple to decode. Writing a basic replication slot worker to start Temporal workflows is potentially much more trivial than using a third-party solution like Sequin and wiring up a whole webhook handler just to bridge that gap. You can just consume the replication stream and start the Temporal worker yourself, no webhooks required. If you use `pg_logical_emit_message()` to emit events, then you don't need to decode any table rows at all, you just look for the message. You could in fact encode the whole Temporal request as a JSON payload to `pg_logical_emit_message()` (not that I would recommend it).",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temporal/comments/1kb3j4q/triggering_temporal_workflows_inside_the_db/mpwzdpn/,2025-04-30T21:52:04+00:00

post_1k6q6vt,,post,Temporal,UpdateWithStart not actioning the second Message,"I'm attempting to migrate an OMS to Temporal and we have 2 messages that we need before being able to action an Order.... The order and the payment.

post_1kdymrj,,post,micro_saas,"Launched an SEO agency directory – 100+ agencies listed, users from 10+ countries, all built solo (no ads)","hey folks, i’ve been in digital marketing for over 10 years now. started out as a software dev, worked with a bunch of companies before diving full-time into digital marketing.

for the longest time, i’ve wanted to build my own platform — something useful. thanks to tools like Lovable, Bolt, and Cursor, I finally stopped dependent on others and shipped it.

launched : [worldwideseo.co](https://worldwideseo.co)  
\> it’s a clean, global directory of SEO agencies  
\> 🌍 already got agencies from the US, Sweden, Australia, etc.  
\> free listings (for now) — trying to help smaller, legit players get discovered  
\> fast, bloat-free UI.

why i built it: finding a good SEO partner *still* sucks. search results are full of ads. i’ve been there — both as a marketer and a founder.

the bigger goal: i want this to be more than a directory.  
  
i’ll be adding curated resources for freelancers, indie makers, and vibe coders. whether you’re an agency owner or a solo dev launching side projects, this could be a channel worth tapping into.

if you want to list your agency, do it — no strings attached.  
if you’ve got ideas on how to make this better, i’m listening.

appreciate any feedback or roasts.

post_1k8koht,,post,indiehackersindia,Built a $5 website audit tool after seeing huge demand for affordable feedback. Would love your thoughts,"Hey everyone,

I noticed something interesting recently and it led me to build a simple $5 tool.

A while ago, someone on Reddit offered free website reviews, and hundreds of founders rushed to get feedback. Separately, while attending a tech conference, I spoke to a branding consultant who charges around $1000 for a full website positioning and branding audit. (A fair price for deep work but way out of reach for early stage founders.)

It hit me: Scrappy founders desperately want outside feedback on their websites but most can’t afford $1000+ services. At the same time, good, actionable feedback can massively change conversion rates, first impressions, and positioning.

So I decided to build a super simple, scrappy tool: • You enter your website URL. • It analyzes your site’s structure, messaging clarity, branding signals, and overall positioning. • It generates a clean, actionable PDF report with improvement suggestions no jargon, no fluff.

It’s obviously not a replacement for deep human consulting but I think it fills a real gap for early founders who need some outside perspective fast and affordably.

I priced it at $5 because I wanted to keep it accessible for early-stage builders.

Here’s the link if you want to check it out: [https://www.critiquekit.com](https://www.critiquekit.com)

I’d love any feedback: • Would you find something like this valuable for your own startup? • What would stop you from using it? • What features would make it 10x more helpful?

Thanks so much for reading. Happy to answer any questions or hear about your own early product launch experiences!",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackersindia/comments/1k8koht/built_a_5_website_audit_tool_after_seeing_huge/,2025-04-26T19:11:16+00:00

post_1kgm7dm,,post,SideProject,I made my first sale this week after 4 months of launch,"This is special because, I have seen several stories on reddit people saying they worked on their ideas for years and have 0 sales. This thought always dreaded me while building [Tryvana](https://tryvana.fit/). I always felt I will end up being one of them. But I want to tell you that no one knows their full story. No one really knows how much effort they actually put in. I made hundreds of tiktoks, and marketed for 2 hours daily non stop for the past few months. To add to the spice, my friend who was working with me also quit after 2 months of no traction. I know $2.99 is nothing but the confidence it gave me to keep going is soo invaluable. So if someone like me who has never sold a thing before can sell in first 4-5 months, you can too. Just keep going and believe that you will figure it out.

comment_mr089f3,post_1kgm7dm,comment,SideProject,,"Hey—spent a few minutes with the site and wanted to give you some structured feedback from a UX/design perspective. The product idea seems strong, but the landing experience isn’t doing the work it needs to. Right now, it feels passive, generic, and visually underpowered. You’re asking users to commit before they’ve seen value, and the design isn’t building trust or interest. Here’s what stood out, and what you could do to fix it:

⸻

1. Visual Hierarchy Feels Incomplete

The layout reads more like a draft than a finished product. There’s too much empty space, no visual flow, and nothing pulling me down the page. It lacks rhythm.

But you could introduce distinct visual blocks—use contrasting backgrounds (dark-on-light, color bands, etc.) to break the monotony and guide the eye. Give each section a defined role and energy. This helps create a sense of movement and intent.

⸻

2. No Brand Presence

Right now, it’s all grayscale and low contrast, so the experience feels flat and noncommittal. There’s no identity coming through.

But you could establish a brand color system and use it to build continuity and personality. Tie buttons, headings, and backgrounds into a cohesive palette. Add some expressive elements—illustrations, gradients, bold shapes—to communicate tone.

⸻

3. Scroll Behavior Isn’t Obvious

On mobile, there’s no indication that the page continues downward. I thought the button was all there was. There’s zero cue to keep going.

But you could add a scroll arrow, animation, or use overlapping content to hint that more exists below the fold. Even slightly reducing the vertical padding would help pull the next section into view and invite interaction.

⸻

4. Misleading UI on the Upload Icon

The “Easy Upload” icon looks exactly like a tappable iOS element—but it’s not functional. That creates false expectations and user frustration.

But you could either redesign it so it doesn’t resemble a native control (flatten it, reduce dimensionality), or better—make it actually functional. Link it to the upload flow or scroll it to a demo. If something looks like a button, it needs to behave like one.

⸻

5. Video Is Buried Too Deep

You’ve got a product explainer video—but it’s buried under paragraphs of text. The video is probably your strongest asset, but it comes too late.

But you could lead with it in the hero section. Make it a focal point—front and center with a strong headline like “Try On Anything Virtually—Here’s How.” Use a clean thumbnail, or autoplay it muted to immediately pull users in.

⸻

6. There’s No Visual Storytelling

You’re offering a try-on experience, but not showing it. There’s no “wow” moment. No transformations, no outcomes, no real-life use cases. I have to imagine what it does.

But you could use short looping demos or before/after GIFs showing people virtually trying on clothes. Include scenarios like “See how it looks before you buy” or “From cart to fitting room in 5 seconds.” Make it real and aspirational.

⸻

7. Typo: “Sheln” Instead of “Shein”

There’s a typo in the Shop Integration section. Small, but instantly kills trust.

But you could fix that copy and go further—add recognizable store logos to reinforce the partnerships and build confidence. Visual proof beats text when it comes to credibility.

⸻

8. No Trial or Interaction Before Login

You’re asking people to upload or sign in before they’ve seen the product in action. That’s high-friction and a fast bounce for most users.

But you could let people run a limited demo—maybe try on one item with a stock photo, or walk through a sample flow. Giving a glimpse of the experience before requiring sign-up is a proven way to build trust and hook interest.

⸻

9. No Selling Energy

You’re not really selling. The copy is calm and descriptive, the visuals are minimal, and the CTAs are passive. I don’t feel like anyone’s really trying to get me excited about this.

But you could rework the tone to pitch harder. Lead with benefits. Add urgency. Use action verbs. Think “Try It Now,” “See It in Action,” “Get Started Free.” Every section should either excite me or convert me—right now, most of it just informs me gently.

⸻

Right now, your landing page feels like a polite invitation to explore an empty room. But you’re offering a visual, interactive, try-on experience—that needs to come through in the first five seconds. Every section should either show value, earn trust, or drive action. You’re not far off, but the current version underplays your strongest assets.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1kgm7dm/i_made_my_first_sale_this_week_after_4_months_of/mr089f3/,2025-05-07T03:23:22+00:00

comment_mqxb120,post_1kgb51y,comment,SideProject,,"**Hey gamers out there!**

6 months ago I wanted to play a game, but as an expert in sophisticated procrastination I started building my own game launcher instead.

\----------------------------------------------

Before doing so, I tried the options out there; Playnite (amazing software), Launchbox, GOG Galaxy 2 etc. I soon realized that none of the options had the features I wanted, namely:

\- A clean, customizable UI without tinkering with code or juggling multiple addons

\- The option to check whether your games are offloaded to the cloud or not. I have a NAS and often offload my DRM-free games to the cloud. I wanted this cloud ""installed state"" to be visible in the app.

\- Portable mode and a simple database structure that allows syncing between devices. In my case, a PC and a handheld device.

\- A clean overview page showing which games you're currently playing and statistics

\- Own-cloud hosted save backups out of the gate

\- A screenshot viewer for all your games

\- The ability to add Emulators to the app and launch games using them

\- How long to beat data out of the box

... list goes on.

\----------------------------------------------

I first built my app using Powershell script, but I quickly realized how ugly that was. It was so fun coding so I continued and instead switched to a Electron / React stack, which my app is built on.

I can talk about this for hours, but I just wanted to get this out there. I'm a guy with many ideas, and this is the first thing I ever release to the public. I'm my worst critic so it's been tough to actually settle on something.

\----------------------------------------------

It's not out yet, but will be very soon. I'll be releasing an 1.0 version with most functionality for free, and an optional paid download with all functionality (custom themes etc). It'll be for a very fair price!

If you're interested, sign up in my mailing list at: [https://lino-library-manager-shop.fourthwall.com](https://lino-library-manager-shop.fourthwall.com) (will buy a domain later on)

post_1kf8abu,,post,microservices,We only used the outbox pattern for failures,"In our distributed system based on microservices, we encountered a delivery problem (tens of thousands of messages per minute).

Instead of implementing the full outbox pattern (with preemptive writes and polling for every event), we decided to fall back to the outbox only when message delivery fails. When everything works as expected, we write to the DB and immediately publish to Kafka.

If publishing fails, the message is written to an outbox\_failed\_messages table, and a background job later retries those.

It’s been running in production for months, and the setup has held up well.

TL;DR:

* Normal flow: write to DB, publish to Kafka
* On failure: write to outbox table
* Background process retries failed ones

This method reduced our outbox traffic by over 95%, saving resources and simplifying the system.

Curious if anyone else has tried something similar?

*(This was a TL;DR of the full write-up by Giulio Cinelli on Medium — happy to link if helpful.)*

post_1g1qn9y,,post,indiehackers,"Hey members, meet your new mod!","Hello to all the members of r/indiehackers 👋

# Who am I?

I'm **Prakhar**, a creative web developer, and an aspiring indie hacker. I call myself aspiring because I haven't earned anything from my projects yet, but I'm already one if indie hacking is just about building stuff!

# How and why am I here?

So as I already said, I am on the path to becoming an Indie hacker, I love to build products that solve some real-life problems. I saw that this subreddit's mod is not active, and this place has been on its own for a while. I recently became a mod of another subreddit with a similar condition, which I'm working on and has already improved quite a bit (it's r/chrome_extensions).

Now with this new experience and joy of building & moderating a community, I thought it would be a great idea to become a mod of this community and make it better in terms of look and content. The good thing is that this place already has good posts and people, so I wouldn't need to do much.

# So, what's next?

Let me ask you all, what do YOU want? **Do you have any suggestions for some improvements?** Or do you think everything's perfect and it just needs a little bit of moderation?

I'm thinking of some events we can organize like AMAs with famous indie hackers, or online meetups of us where we can talk, share and solve each other's problems.

But **let me your ideas in the comments**, I will be actively reading and replying to all of your comments.

Let's make this community better together!

Thanks for reading, Take care <3

post_1kgaz95,,post,indiehackers,Product Hunt alternative for indie makers SoloPush hit 1.5k users in 36 days with no ads,"while indie maker experience biggest thing i noticed was how easy it is for indie stuff to get ignored on big launch sites.

if you don’t already have an audience or aren’t part of some well-known team, most launches go nowhere. no one sees them unless you promote hard or pay for reach.

so i made [SoloPush](https://solopush.com), Product Hunt alternative for solo makers. idea was simple. make a launch space that actually works for solo builders. where your product doesn’t vanish after 24 hours. where being small isn’t a disadvantage.

other platforms exist but felt the same. launch, then gone. unless you pay to be seen.  30$ just to get listed faster and 90$ to stay on here. didn’t feel right.

i put SoloPush live on april 1. launching is free. there’s a waitlist because a lot of folks are submitting. you can pay a little to skip it but you don’t have to. after launch, your product stays up in its category. top tools bubble up slowly, not just based on hype from day one.

top 3 each day get a Product of the Day badge. also every product get Featured on SoloPush badge to use wherever. small stuff, but helps with proof.

in 5 weeks it’s gotten over 1.5k users, 600+ products, and around 30k weekly visits. all organic. mostly just sharing on reddit and twitter.

still early but trying to build a place that respects indie time and energy. not just a one-day spike, but long-term visibility.

post_1kgpzwb,,post,indiehackers,Yay! We just landed our first enterprise customer at $1500 + many others paying $60 and above,"The journey has been long and hard. We started back in August with an idea to build something tangible, but our first few attempts didn't attract user attention.

We were trying to find a problem to fit our solutions. By December, we thought we had a good idea addressing a personal pain point, but found zero users willing to pay for it.

Then came the eureka moment! With over 10 years of mobile app development experience and 5+ million users across our projects, we had a revelation in January. We were building a digital presence for a client who paid us upfront but later ditched us for a cheaper template solution.

This setback sparked a realization: with our codegen expertise and domain knowledge, why not build a product that empowers businesses to create their own mobile apps?

We started building, noticed competitors emerging (some even getting funded), but we stayed focused on our unique target audience. We kept refining our process through constant customer feedback to make our product as frictionless as possible.

Ten days ago, we finally revealed our product. The response has been insane:

* Over 2,500 mobile apps built
* 40 minutes average session time
* 66% of users on $60+ plans
* Multiple customers paying up to $300/month
* One enterprise customer on a $1,500 plan

Our secret? Deep understanding of the problem space + dedicating 2 hours every day talking to users and watching them work live. We even schedule calls with people not using our platform just to understand their pain points.

This approach has finally translated to revenue. Sharing this for anyone who needs motivation to: a) Keep going b) Build a habit of talking to your users every day",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1kgpzwb/yay_we_just_landed_our_first_enterprise_customer/,2025-05-07T05:45:35+00:00

post_1jpmloz,,post,SaaS,"Built, bootstrapped, exited. $2M revenue, $990k AppSumo, 6-figure exit at $33k MRR (email industry). AmA!","I’m Kalo Yankulov, and together with Slav u/slavivanov, we co-founded [Encharge](https://encharge.io/) – a marketing automation platform built for SaaS.

After university, I used to think I’d end up at some fancy design/marketing agency in London, but after a short stint, I realized I hated it, so I threw myself into building my own startups. Encharge is my latest product. 

Some interesting facts:

1. We reached $400k in ARR before the exit.
2. We launched an AppSumo campaign that ranked in the top 5 all-time most successful launches. Generating $990k in revenue in 1 month. I slept a total of 5 hours in the 1st week of the launch, doing support. 
3. We sold recently for 6 figures. 
4. The whole product was built by just one person — my amazing co-founder Slav.
5. We pre-sold lifetime deals to validate the idea.
6. Our only growth channel is organic. We reached 73 DR, outranking goliaths like HubSpot and Mailchimp for many relevant keywords. We did it by writing deep, valuable content (e.g., [onboarding emails](https://encharge.io/onboarding-emails)) and building links.

What’s next for me and Slav:

* I used the momentum of my [previous (smaller) exit](https://encharge.io/idea-to-exit/) to build pre-launch traction for Encharge. I plan to use the same playbook as I start working on my next SaaS idea, using the momentum of the current exit. In the meantime, I’d love to [help early and mid-stage startups grow](https://kalo.me/mentorship); you can check how we can work together here.
* Slav is taking a sabbatical to spend time with his 3 kids before moving onto the next venture. You can read his blog and connect with him [here](https://slavv.com/). 

Here to share all the knowledge we have. Ask us anything about:

* SaaS 
* Bootstrapping
* Email industry 
* Growth marketing/content/SEO
* Acquisitions

Participating in Ama first time, i don't know how it goes.

But just want to ask if it is worth it to sell on AppSumo?

Which plan did you choose? Normal or AppSumo Select? 

does those lifetime users become huge liability of the saas? 

Thanks in advance boss! Hope you grow more :)",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1jpmloz/built_bootstrapped_exited_2m_revenue_990k_appsumo/ml0dcbx/,2025-04-02T12:01:13+00:00

post_1kgng1a,,post,SaaS,When attempting to scale their products 90% of Upwork SaaS Builds Fa,"Founders contact me when problems occur with their product because it crashes or both crawls and corrupts data. The story is usually the same: The founder hired an individual freelancer at a low cost who delivered a functioning product before disappearing. After setting up to work I access the repository only to discover the codebase is a makeshift patchwork.  
  
Here’s what I keep seeing:  
  
One five‑thousand‑line file that controls everything  
  
Secrets hard‑coded straight into the source  
  
The code depends on third-party libraries which lack support from other developers globally  
  
Zero automated tests or CI/CD  
  
Magic numbers and copy‑pasted SQL everywhere  
  
Why it happens:  
  
The importance of shipping now exceeds the need to ship in the next quarter.  
  
Single developers typically lack experience with team collaboration and code review processes.  
  
Founders without technical expertise fail to recognize issues until they create major disruptions.  
  
Quick seven-point review system designed to detect most disasters early on.  
  
Separate branches for main, develop, and features  
  
Automated deploys, no manual FTP uploads  
  
At least basic unit test coverage  
  
Centralized logging, not scattered console prints  
  
Depend on well‑supported libraries, not abandonware  
  
Minimal docs: a readme, an architecture sketch, onboarding steps  
  
Outside code review every quarter",473,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1kgng1a/when_attempting_to_scale_their_products_90_of/,2025-05-07T03:13:42+00:00

post_1kgpnrz,,post,SaaS,I made a product that people like and pay for! Earned 479$,"I developed Unlust around a month ago and launched it. It has since received 1k+ downloads. I recently added the community feature and just saw a user add this post, and people supported him. It feels like, finally, after several iterations, I can make a product that people like and pay for.

Now my years of 9-5 5-9 struggles seem to give some results!

It’s been proven that customers are likely to churn no matter what by the 6 month mark for most products unless the product is so insanely good or integrated into their business that they can’t afford to operate without it.

Your product seems cool but I don’t think people are going to be using it every day for multiple years.
